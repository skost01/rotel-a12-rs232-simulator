# Rotel A12 RS232-Simulator
This sketch makes your Arduino respond to commands over serial communication like the Rotel A12 amplifier would. Can be used to develop programs to control the amp without the need to connect it. Not all commands are implemented, speaker and dimmer commands are missing.

Change volume on the Arduino using a rotary encoder, pressing the encoder button sets random frequency for immaginary digital source input. Another button sets random source.
